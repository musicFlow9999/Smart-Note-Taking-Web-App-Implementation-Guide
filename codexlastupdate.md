# Smart Notes Azure App Service - Database Directory Creation Issue
**Date**: June 13, 2025 05:55 UTC  
**Status**: UNRESOLVED - Directory Creation Error Persists  

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE: ENOENT Directory Creation Error

The app is experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error when creating documents due to:
```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/home/site/wwwroot/data'
```

**Root Cause**: Azure App Service directory permissions preventing SQLite database directory creation.

**Environment**: smart-notes-app-lamb2025.azurewebsites.net (smart-notes-rg-west)

## Previous Fixes Completed ✅
- Database migration check for `user_id` column
- Environment variables (JWT_SECRET, DB_FILE, Application Insights)
- GitHub Actions deployment pipeline
- Enhanced logging and error handling
- Dependencies tracking in Git

## Current Status
- App Service: Running (health check passes)
- Database: Initialization failing on directory creation
- Logs: Enhanced but directory creation still fails despite fallback logic

### Next Steps
**IMMEDIATE**: 
1. Change DB_FILE environment variable to writable Azure path (`/tmp/notes_v2.db` or `D:\home\data\notes_v2.db`)
2. Test document creation API after path change
3. Consider Kudu console access for manual directory testing

**ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS**: 
- Azure SQL Database for production-grade database
- Azure Storage for file-based database storage
- In-memory database for temporary testing
