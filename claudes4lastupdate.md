## Environment Debug Notes (June 12, 2025)

- Working directory correctly set to `backend`, but `npm start` still searches for `package.json` in the repository root.
- `node_modules` is absent in the Codex container, so tests cannot run without `npm install`.
- Recommend ensuring the development environment has dependencies installed and verifying the `start` script path.
